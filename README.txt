Through the prompt analysis, we are analyzing if a customer will accept a coupon when she or he is driving. 

Finding Summary:
The analysis mainly focuses on two types of coupons, the bar coupon and coffee house coupon. Through analysis, we found that different drivers are attracted to different kind of coupons. As a common behavior, drivers who pay more frequent visits to the coupon place in the past are more likely to accept that certain type of coupon. For instance drivers who used to went to a bar more than 3 times a month are more likely to accept a bar coupon. Another common factor in the rate of acceptance of coupon is age, as drivers older than 25 are more likely to use a bar coupon, coffee house coupon are more welcomed among drivers under 21. As bars serve alcohol, drivers that use the bar coupon usually don't have a kid in the car at the time and have a higher income. Coffee bar coupon users are less concerned on the passenger and income side as most are students. As a final recommendation, we also encourage giving out coupon that last longer like one day instead of a short 2 hr coupon to increase the acceptance rate.
